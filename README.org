* linux_conf
** Linux Dotfiles and XDG Struct

*** This is a small script for all linux platforms and MacOs.

This script is install.sh. In order to use the config clone this repo.

#+NAME: Install Instructions
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/FoulBachelor/linux_conf && ./install.sh
#+END_SRC

This will install my config for vim, zsh, terminal emulator and some other goodies.

This goes well with a separate i3 config, but is not necessary.

After installation you can toggle TMUX in the shell with Ctrl+T. In TMUX Alt+S and Alt+V create panes. Alt+C creates a window. Alt+Q closes active pane or window.

Terminal is the new suckless terminal installed. It should be used as default, if not it can be launched with "st" from $PATH.

Terminal can be configured with st_config and recompiled with st_build.
