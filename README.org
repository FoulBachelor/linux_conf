* linux_conf
** Linux Dotfiles and XDG Struct

*** This is a small script for all linux platforms and MacOs.

This script is install.sh. In order to use the config clone this repo.

CD into the project and run sudo chmod +x install.sh and ./install.sh

This will install my config for vim, zsh, terminal emulator and some other goodies.

This goes well with a separate i3 config, but is not necessary.
